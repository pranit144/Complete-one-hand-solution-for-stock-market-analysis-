## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up StockSight on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
*   A valid API key from a financial data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).  You'll need to create an account and obtain an API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    5.  **Access the Dashboard:** Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL (`http://localhost:3000` by default).
6.  **Enter Stock Symbol:** Use the search bar to enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla).
7.  **View Stock Data:** The dashboard will display real-time quotes, historical data, and key financial metrics for the selected stock.
8.  **Interact with Charts:** Use the interactive charts to analyze trends and patterns in the stock's performance.  You can zoom in, zoom out, and select different time periods.
9. **Set up Alerts**: Navigate to the alerts section and configure alerts based on price thresholds or news events.
10. **Customize your Dashboard:**  Add or remove widgets to personalize your StockSight dashboard.

> Example: To view Apple's stock data, simply enter 'AAPL' in the search bar and press Enter. The dashboard will then populate with relevant information about Apple's stock.
